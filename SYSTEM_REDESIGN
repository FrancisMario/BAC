I had to make a system redesign becouse we were headed to alot of complexities further down the road


System Change 1

There are two types of accounts now
    1: Admin account.
    2: Business account (user).

The Admin Accounts will have the following features

-   Business Account Activities
    -   Register new business accounts to the system <CODE: N9TT>
    -   Edit business account Details <CODE: N9G0>
    -   Delete business accounts <CODE: NGE4>
    -   Create a *ledger for business accounts <CODE: NGE4>
    -   Modify business account *ledger details. <CODE: NSXF>
    -   Delete a *ledger for business accounts. <CODE: NHYO>

-   Admin Account Activities

    -   Register new admin accounts to the system. <CODE: 2YNV>
    -   Modify admin accounts details. <CODE: 2GNV>
    -   Issue/Revoke admin account rights. <CODE: 2ARD>
    -   Create admin groups <CODE: 2MOP> <grouping accounts with the same work and giving it a name so you can control those accounts as a group>
    -   Delete accounts. <CODE: 2OT6>
    -   Suspend accounts. <CODE: 2L4F> <admin won't be able to log into the system until the suspension period ends>

Because of the above changes SIGNING UP is no more a required feature.

The intitial user SYS_ADM will have the rights to create Admin account.
    -   He will have all the rights in the system.
    -   He bea able t lockdown and unlock the system.

The Business accounts as o fnow will only have the following features for now.

-   Update Address
-   Update Contact Details
-   Add *Branches 
-   View *Ledgers
-   View *Ledger Deposits
-   Print *Ledger Deposit reciept 

Authorisation Method
